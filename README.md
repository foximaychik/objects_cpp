# Object C++
My first OOP Program on cpp. This program can create objects and destroy them. You can modify this project if you want!

Destroy and Create(Add) functions:
```
void Obj::ObjAdd(int num) {
        cout << "Objects added in number " << num << endl;
        m_obj += num;
}
void Obj::ObjDel(int num) {
        cout << "Objects deleted in number " << num << endl;
        m_obj -= num;
}
```

Was inspired by Minecraft and Java Language (Only OOP-based lang).
